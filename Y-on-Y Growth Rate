/*

This is the same question as problem #32 in the SQL Chapter of Ace the Data Science Interview!

Assume you're given a table containing information about Wayfair user transactions for different products.
Write a query to calculate the year-on-year growth rate for the total spend of each product, grouping the results by product ID.

The output should include the year in ascending order, 
product ID, current year's spend, previous year's spend and year-on-year growth percentage, rounded to 2 decimal places.

########## My Solution Is As Below ############

-- SUM(product) GROUP BY product
-- Year ASC, product_id, current_years_spend, prev, YoY%
-- (cun year - prev year)/prev year
WITH CTE AS(
SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM transaction_date) AS year,
       product_id,
       SUM(spend) AS curr_year_spend,
       LAG(spend) OVER(PARTITION BY product_id) AS prev_year_spend
FROM user_transactions
GROUP BY product_id, EXTRACT(YEAR FROM transaction_date), spend
ORDER BY product_id)

SELECT year AS yr,
       product_id,
       curr_year_spend,
       prev_year_spend,
       ROUND((curr_year_spend-prev_year_spend)/prev_year_spend * 100.0,2) AS yoy_rate
FROM CTE
ORDER BY product_id
