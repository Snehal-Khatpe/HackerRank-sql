-- FAANG HARD

/* 
You work as a data analyst for a FAANG company that tracks employee salaries over time. 
The company wants to understand how the average salary in each department compares to the company's overall average salary each month.

Write a query to compare the average salary of employees in each department to the company's average salary for March 2024. 
Return the comparison result as 'higher', 'lower', or 'same' for each department. Display the department ID, payment month (in MM-YYYY format), and the comparison result.

-- My Solution is as below

WITH CTE AS(
SELECT payment_date, AVG(s.amount) AS avg_dept,
       e.department_id
FROM employee e
JOIN salary s
ON e.employee_id = s.employee_id 
AND payment_date >= '03/01/2024 00:00:00' 
AND payment_date <= '03/31/2024 00:00:00'
GROUP BY e.department_id, payment_date)

SELECT department_id,
       TO_CHAR(payment_date, 'MM-YYYY') AS payment_date,
       CASE WHEN avg_dept < (SELECT AVG(amount) FROM salary) THEN 'lower'
            WHEN avg_dept > (SELECT AVG(amount) FROM salary) THEN 'higher'
            ELSE 'same'
            END AS comparison
FROM CTE
