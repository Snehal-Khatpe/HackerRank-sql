/*
For each FAANG stock, display the ticker symbol, the month and year ('Mon-YYYY') with the corresponding highest and lowest open prices (refer to the Example Output format). 
Ensure that the results are sorted by ticker symbo
*/

####### My Solution is as below ########

WITH open_max AS(
SELECT ticker,
       TO_CHAR(date, 'Mon-YYYY') AS highest_mth,
       open,
       DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY ticker ORDER BY open DESC) r1
FROM stock_prices
), 

open_min AS (
SELECT ticker,
       TO_CHAR(date, 'Mon-YYYY') AS lowest_mth,
       open,
       DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY ticker ORDER BY open ASC) r2
FROM stock_prices)

SELECT open_max.ticker AS ticker,
       highest_mth,
       open_max.open AS highest_open,
       open_min.lowest_mth,
       open_min.open AS lowest_open
FROM open_max 
JOIN open_min 
ON open_max.ticker = open_min.ticker
WHERE r1 = 1 AND r2 = 1 
ORDER BY ticker ASC
