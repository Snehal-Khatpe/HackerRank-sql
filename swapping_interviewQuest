/*
If the last item has an odd order ID, it should remain as the last item in the corrected data. For example, 
if the last item is Order ID 7 Tandoori Chicken, then it should remain as Order ID 7 in the corrected data.

In the results, return the correct pairs of order IDs and items.
*/

######### My solution is as below ################ 
 SELECT 
        CASE WHEN order_id%2 != 0 AND order_id = (SELECT MAX(order_id) FROM orders) THEN order_id
             WHEN order_id%2 != 0 AND order_id != (SELECT MAX(order_id) FROM orders) THEN order_id+1
             ELSE order_id-1
        END AS test,
        item
FROM orders
ORDER BY test
